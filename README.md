==================

If your presentation is in a PDF and you're doing it over video conference.  It
is nice sometimes to share a single window. Separately, in another PDF, you can
have your presenter notes. This program gives you a way to turn to the
next/previous page based on a single button click (in the GUI)/key press (left
right).
